# Introduction
Welcome to _The Dat Protocol_, a technical book about [The Dat
Project](https://datproject.org/). The Dat protocol is a p2p hypermedia
protocol. It provides public-key-addressed file archives which can be synced
securely and browsed on-demand.

## Who This Book Is For
This book is written for people interested in understanding the details of the
Dat protocol, and potentially implementing parts of it themselves. We go into
details about the different components that make up the protocol, and provide
guidance on how to approach an implementation yourself.

This book is different from the [Dat Enhancement Proposals
(DEPs)](https://www.datprotocol.com/deps/). DEPs focus on creating
standardization and specification of the Dat protocol. This book focuses on
providing an introduction to key concepts, and guidance on how to implement
them.
